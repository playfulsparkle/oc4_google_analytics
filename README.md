### What is Google Analytics (GA4)?
Google Analytics (GA4) is the newest version of Google’s powerful tool for tracking and understanding website and app activity. Unlike previous versions, GA4 uses machine learning to provide insights into customer behavior across different devices and platforms. It’s designed to help businesses see what’s working, make data-driven decisions, and improve the user experience easily.

Google Analytics (GA4) is used to track and analyze how people interact with websites and apps, giving businesses insights into their customers’ actions and preferences. It allows you to see details like where visitors come from, what pages they view, and how long they stay. GA4 can also track specific events, such as when users click a button, complete a form, or make a purchase.

The benefits of GA4 include a more complete view of the customer journey, as it combines data from both websites and apps into one place. Its advanced machine learning models can automatically detect trends, predict future behaviors, and uncover hidden insights, helping businesses optimize marketing strategies. Additionally, GA4’s event-based tracking is more flexible than past versions, allowing for better customization and a clearer understanding of user engagement.
